## Raw Data to Tidy Data by following Steps
1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each     activity and each subject
